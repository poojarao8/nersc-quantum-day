### Potential projects

1. Modify the qubit rotation example to move the bloch vector along the x   direction. 

2. Teleport a quantum state from Alice to Bob. 

3. Implement a 3 qubit quantum Fourier transform. 

4. Extend the hybrid qnns example to include a multi-qubit circuit, why not add the 8-qubit aca dataset to try improve accuracy with quantum and classical nodes? 

5. For the qnn example, code up a function to perform gradient descent by shifting parameters individually rather than simultaneously and compare the number of circuit evaluations as a function of epochs for both approaches. 

6. Demonstrate the barren plateau phenomena - show that as you increase qubit sizes, the variance in the gradient decreases. \

10. Modify the qnn example, use a sci-kit learn dataset and implement the data reupload technique.

11. Classical shadows is a powerful technique to reconstruct quantum states by measuring the circuit in random bases and postprocessing the data. Implement this in CUDA Quantum. \
